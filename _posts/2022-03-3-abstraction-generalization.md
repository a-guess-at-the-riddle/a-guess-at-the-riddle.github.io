title: Abstraction and Generalization

What is the difference in meaning (more specifically in connotation) between the terms generalization and abstraction?

First recall the classical distinction in philosophy between objects and attributes. This is also recaptitulated in the distinction between logical extension and comprehension.

Generalization is associated with increasing the number of objects that compose the signified class (the extension) and abstraction is associated with decreasing the "amount?" of qualities specified by that same signified class (comprehension). But these are just two ways of describing what is essentially the same process because objects/extension and attributes/comprehension are inversely related by the somewhat vague equation "extension × comprehension = information".

Before moving on we should review some elementary mathematics so as to understand the meaning of this equation. Recall that an equation of the form y = k*x where k is some constant number and x and y are variables implies that the variables x and y are directly proportional. That is, if x increases by some amount then y increases by that same amount. Proportionality and linearity only differ in one aspect. That is linearity has the extra characteristic of a constant (or zero) being added to the independent variable (i.e., y=mx+b), what we call the y-intercept in the standard linear equations.

The equation "extension × comprehension = information" can be represented symbolically as "e × c = i", where "e", "c", and "i" are all real variables. Unlike the equation in the former paragraph which had two variables, geometrically a line, this equation has three variables, geometrically a surface, and more specifically, a rotated and stretched hyperbolic paraboloid.

To understand the isolated (i.e. ceterus paribus) relationship between two variables say "e" and "c" we hold the third variable constant, say "i". So if "i" is fixed and we increase "e" by some amount we are forced by necessity to therefore decrease "c" by the same amount as we want the equation to remain true.

So when you generalize something say "dog" -> "animal" the number of objects that compose the class being referenced increases and the number of qualities attributed to that same class of objects goes down. That is to say the class "animal" contains more members than the class "dog", and it is simultaneously true that it takes less attributes to specify the class "animal" than it takes to specify the class "dog".

So what is it about the essence of objects vs essence of attributes that makes them have opposite hierarchies (opposite directions on the concept lattice)?

Well when a list of objects is specified there is a presupposition that the set is at first empty (I think?). But when a list of properties is specified there is an explicitly stated context such as "x is in R, such that ...". The set is at first all properties belonging to the objects of the context set. That is, for example in set theory the element listing method is additive starting from the null set and set-builder notion that starts with a larger set and filters the elements using conditions (i.e., properties).

So when we come across the noun phrase such as "quick brown fox", "fox" increases the extension and "quick brown" moves backwards from the vague class "fox" to decreasing properties?

Of course one could imagine using an enumerative method to list elements that implicitly subtract from a larger set as well. But it seems when specifying a set of objects by their shared properties/attributes the only type of selection method is one that is subtractive (filter). Why is this?

The "not", "all", and "some" operators...

I had a thought related to the first topic. I think I can justify why stating a noun should be thought of as moving away from no content as opposed to moving away from infinite content. If you state "Alice and Bob" then the composition of the two nouns moves you in the direction of more content (as opposed to just "Alice"). So if adding two nouns results in having more content than just one noun shouldn't declaring one noun mean you are adding content on top of no content for the idea to be consistent. (edited)

I guess that argument is relies somewhat on certain intuitive preferences we have.

But I could imagine it better to be thought in a dual sense. Like figure/backround

Regardless of whether declaring objects/nouns is additive or subtractive, I still hold the opinion (though I'm some not certain) that describing properties/conditions is only negative.



misc.

connotation?
note that forms vs content distinction seems similar to denotation vs connotation and extension vs comprehension
properties as "absential"?

lossy vs lossless compression vs abstraction/generalization???
